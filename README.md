# Corrosion Detection using YOLOv3

![Corrosion Detection](corrosion_detection.jpg)

This repository contains a model implemented using the YOLOv3 algorithm foto detect corrosion in concrete structures. The model has been trained on a custom dataset of images of various concrete structures, focusing on identifying areas affected by corrosion.

## Repository Contents

- `corrosion_detection_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training the YOLOv3 model on the corrosion detection dataset.
- `corrosion_weights.pth`: Pre-trained weights of the YOLOv3 model after training on the corrosion detection dataset.
- `data/`: Directory containing the training dataset images and annotations.
- `utils/`: Directory containing utility functions for data preprocessing and post-processing of the model's predictions.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/corrosion-detection.git`.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Place your own dataset in the `data/` directory with corresponding annotations.
4. Run the `corrosion_detection_model.ipynb` notebook to train the model on your dataset.
5. Once trained, you can use the trained weights in your applications for corrosion detection.
